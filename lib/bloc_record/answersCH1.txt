1.
  SELECT DISTINCT something FROM something
  Post.all.uniq!
  (selects what we want then makes it uniq)

2. SELECT something
   FROM something
   WHERE (here would be any boolean or inequality)

   SELECT * FROM posts WHERE (boolean, inequality,.....)
   (select all posts based on the inequality for example,
   then push them to a new array or data structure based on the inequality)

3. SELECT * FROM post ORDER BY whatever
  (this would sort selected values)
  Post.order("whatever")

4. SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT (some value)
  (this one is great for me with working with lots of data, query a limited amount of data)
  Post.limit(googleplex)

5. SELECT * FROM something GROUP BY something
Post.all.group_by(something)


6. SELECT MAX(post) FROM post
  this will return the maximum one. we also can use AVG, COUNT, MIn and SUM

  post.max(id)

7.

SELECT * FROM table0 CROSS JOIN table1

Im confused with Inner and Outer Join.
maybe like this?

INNER JOIN table1 ON column1
OUTER JOIN table2 ON column2
